            <h2>
                We have entrance signs?
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you're asking this very question right now - SURPRISE!! We do, in fact, have entrance signs. They are
                located at White Chapel & Weldon Spring.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 my-2 py-2 rounded-3 border shadow-lg bg-dark text-white">
            <h2>Can the signs be repainted?
            </h2>
            The signs have been either repainted or repaired in some manner throughout the last 30+ years. The wood is
            deteriorating and repainting isn't going to do much at this juncture. You can see the state of the wood in the photos. Restoration was explored during the
            information-gathering phase. It was advised it wouldn't be worth the money or work to try to paint or
            restore the wooden inserts at their current age/state. It was recommended to instead look at maintenance
            items such as doing restoration on the brick work, which would be a more worthwhile investment.

            <h2>How would we pay for this?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The subdivision plans to use cash-on-hand in the subdivision account homeowners have already been
                contributing to over time through their annual fees. Money in this account can be used for improvements,
                community events, maintenance items, and operating expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, no extra cost would be incurred by the homeowners for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Costs will likely continue to creep up if action is delayed further down the road. (For example, the
                company whose signage quote was presented at the annual meeting in 2021 was asked to re-quote this year,
                and their costs have increased by over $800 since the 2021 proposal.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Funds for either replacement or demolition will come out of the subdivision's savings account. The current savings and projected checking account balances are noted below.
                We included the "projected" checking balance as this project would be paid for after the 2023 assessments are collected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Savings: $19,300 <br>
                Projected checking: $14,100
            </p>
            <p>
                The subdivision is budgeting $9,800 in operating expenses for 2023. Our biggest cost right now is lawn care & landscaping. We are reviewing options to manage this part of our operating expenses going into 2023.

            <h2>Why don't we have signs at Brougham? Can we get signs there?
            </h2>
            The developer decided where to place signs when the subdivision was being built. If we had a time machine,
            it certainly would be interesting to go back and learn why one entrance has signage and not the other. Since
            that is not a possibility, we are focusing on what we currently have in place that needs attention: the
            monument signs at White Chapel.</p>
            <p>We know some people may feel strongly about not having signs at Brougham. We also know we need to be
                mindful of our available funds, and more research needs to be done around what would be allowed on the
                Brougham easements.</p>
            <p>If the replacement vote passes, we will need to review additional projects over time as funds allow (such
                as Brougham signs or restoring the monument brick work).</p>
            <p>(*If anyone does know how to time travel, please let us know. That sounds pretty fun.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 my-2 py-2 rounded-3 border shadow-lg bg-dark text-white">
            <h2>Can I vote if I have an outstanding balance with the subdivision?

            </h2>
            Since the subdivision would use funds in an account homeowner's have been paying into via annual fees, it is
            fair that votes are qualified from homeowners who are contributing equitably to the subdivision. If you are
            a homeowner who has an outstanding balance (your fee letter indicated you owed more than $50 this year),
            your vote can be qualified if your account is caught up by March 1st.
            <p> </p>
            As a reminder, all homeowner's annual fees are due March 1st as well, which is when voting will close.

            <h2>What's HDU?
            </h2>
            High-Density Urethane (HDU) is a strong, naturally waterproof material engineered specifically to make signs.
            It is a preferred material for sign shops not only for its durability, but because it is easier than wood to cut, carve, and route, which reduces the overall cost.
            All of the sign companies we spoke with during the process recommended this material. HDU in signage is incredibly
            common. Many subdivisions and businesses have HDU signage, and you may not even realize it. Some examples include:
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://carriage-hills-subdivision.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documents/example-sign-1.png" class="light-link">Incline Village (Foristell)</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://carriage-hills-subdivision.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documents/example-sign-2.jpeg" class="light-link">Good News Brewing (St. Charles)</a></li>
                <li>100 Miranda Court (Wentzville)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As HDU is waterproof, it is unaffected by the elements and will not rot, decompose, splinter, crack, or peel with time. It will
                also not swell or shrink with the weather like wood does. It can even be sandblasted to replicate wood grain, brick, or other special effects. Creative Graphic Solutions stated the vast majority
                of subdivisions and businesses are choosing HDU due to durability and cost. The company has replaced and upgraded a number of
                subdivision's signage and the original wood signs have been replaced with the HDU material (Incline Village listed above is one example). They also noted they have yet to have to do replacement
                or repair on signs that have been installed using this material.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the sign is routed, it will be painted and UV treated to resist fading. HDU signage is expected to look like new
                for, at minimum, 10 years. Anything left out in the elements will start to show effects from the sun over time (there is
                no way to 100% prevent this), and the paint can be refreshed as time goes on. A paint refresh will be the general maintenance item as the sign material
                itself is impervious to the elements and will not deteriorate. Most look at doing maintenance on their signage at the 20-ish+ year mark after it has started to really fade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Swing by any of the examples listed above if you'd like to check out an HDU sign in the wild.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creative Graphic Solution has also loaned out a sample of unpainted HDU. **Starting the evening of January 26th,
                a sample will be available at the Little Library on Brougham. Feel free to swing by & check it out. Please
                be sure to replace the sample in the container when finished.**

            <h2>What companies would we be using?
            </h2>
            <p>
            Replacement: Creative Graphic Solution in Lake Saint Louis.
                <br>
                We spoke to five companies and received three quotes. Creative Graphic Solutions had the most competitive pricing with comparable options, and they did a great job on the designs.
            </p>
                Demolition: Eagle-Edge Construction in Cottleville.<br>
                We received two estimates on this option. The other quote was significantly higher and not competitive.</br>

        <div class="col-12 my-2 py-2 rounded-3 border shadow-lg bg-dark text-white">
            <h2>I don't like the design. Can we change it?
            </h2>
            <p>We will not be modifying the design at this juncture. A lot of work and time was invested to get to this point with designs and pricing. A decision needed to
                be made in order to move forward with this vote, and we are requesting a vote on what is currently
                proposed. At minimum, we hope you will find the new designs a nice upgrade from what's currently in
                place.</p>

            <h2>What happens after the vote?
            </h2>
            <p>Action will be taken depending on the outcome of this vote. If replacement doesn't pass, there is no
                guarantee on when this project would be explored again. It would be up to the board members in place in the future.
                This project does not require homeowner approval nor a minimum number of votes to be submitted. The board decided to put a vote out to the
                subdivision as this extra money is outside the normal amount of what the subdivision would spend in a
                year. There is a lot of information on this site regarding replacement, but options to completely remove
                the monuments or leave them as-is is included as voting options if that's what the majority wants to see
                happen. It is important you vote on the option you'd like to see implemented now.</p>

                        Carriage Hills in place. Everything would be removed: The existing signs, brick structures, concrete pads, and landscaping
                        would be excavated. Plot would be seeded with grass. No replacement monuments or signage would
