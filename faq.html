                We have entrance signs?
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you're asking this very question right now - SURPRISE! We do, in fact, have entrance signs. They are located at White Chapel & Weldon Spring. The wooden inserts are original from the late 1980's and what we are currently voting on.

            <h2>Can the signs be repainted?
            </h2>
            The signs have been either repainted or repaired in some manner throughout the last 30+ years. The wood is deteriorating and repainting isn't going to do much at this juncture. Restoration was explored during the information-gathering phase. The direction indicated was: it wouldn't be worth the money or work to repair the wooden inserts at their current age/state, however, the subdivision could look at doing restoration on the brick work, which would be a more worthwhile investment.

            <h2>How would we pay for this?
            </h2>
            The subdivision plans to use cash-on-hand in the subdivision account homeowners have already been contributing to over time through their annual fees. Money in this account is designated for improvements, community events, maintenance items, and operating expenses.
            <p></p>

            Again, no extra cost would be incurred by the homeowners for this project.
            <p></p>

            Costs will likely continue to creep up if action is delayed further down the road.
