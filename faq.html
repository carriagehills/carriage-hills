            <h2>
                We have entrance signs?
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you're asking this very question right now - SURPRISE! We do, in fact, have entrance signs. They are
                located at White Chapel & Weldon Spring. The wooden inserts are original from the late 1980's and what
                we are currently voting on.

            <h2>Can the signs be repainted?
            </h2>
            The signs have been either repainted or repaired in some manner throughout the last 30+ years. The wood is
            deteriorating and repainting isn't going to do much at this juncture. You can see the state of the wood in the photos. Restoration was explored during the
            information-gathering phase. It was advised it wouldn't be worth the money or work to try to paint or
            restore the wooden inserts at their current age/state. It was recommended to instead look at maintenance
            items such as doing restoration on the brick work, which would be a more worthwhile investment.

            <h2>How would we pay for this?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The subdivision plans to use cash-on-hand in the subdivision account homeowners have already been
                contributing to over time through their annual fees. Money in this account can be used for improvements,
                community events, maintenance items, and operating expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, no extra cost would be incurred by the homeowners for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Costs will likely continue to creep up if action is delayed further down the road. (For example, the
                company whose signage quote was presented at the annual meeting in 2021 was asked to re-quote this year,
                and their costs have increased by over $800 since the 2021 proposal.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Funds for either replacement or demolition will come out of the subdivision's savings account. The current savings and projected checking account balances are noted below.
                We included the "projected" checking balance as this project would be paid for after the 2023 assessments are collected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Savings: (info updated soon)
            </p>
            <p>
                Projected checking balance after March 1st: $18,042
            </p>
            <p>
                The subdivision is budgeting $9,600 in operating expenses for 2023. Our biggest cost right now is lawncare & landscaping. We are reviewing options to manage this part of our operating expenses going into 2023.

            <h2>Why don't we have signs at Brougham? Can we get signs there?
            </h2>
            The developer decided where to place signs when the subdivision was being built. If we had a time machine,
            it certainly would be interesting to go back and learn why one entrance has signage and not the other. Since
            that is not a possibility, we are focusing on what we currently have in place that needs attention: the
            monument signs at White Chapel.</p>
            <p>We know some people may feel strongly about not having signs at Brougham. We also know we need to be
                mindful of our available funds, and more research needs to be done around what would be allowed on the
                Brougham easements.</p>
            <p>If the replacement vote passes, we will need to review additional projects over time as funds allow (such
                as Brougham signs or restoring the monument brick work).</p>
            <p>(*If anyone does know how to time travel, please let us know. That sounds pretty fun.)</p>

            <h2>Can I vote if I have an outstanding balance with the subdivision?

            </h2>
            Since the subdivision would use funds in an account homeowner's have been paying into via annual fees, it is
            fair that votes are qualified from homeowners who are contributing equitably to the subdivision. If you are
            a homeowner who has an outstanding balance (your fee letter indicated you owed more than $50 this year),
            your vote can be qualified if your account is caught up by March 1st.
            <p> </p>
            As a reminder, all homeowner's annual fees are due March 1st as well, which is when voting will close.

            <h2>What's HDU?
            </h2>
            Coming soon. Creative Graphic Solutions has offered a raw sample of the HDU material if a homeowner wants to check it out. More will be noted here later.

            <p>
            Replacement: Creative Graphic Solutions in Lake Saint Louis.
                <br>
                We received three quotes. Creative Graphic Solutions had the most competitive pricing with comparable options, and they did a great job on the designs.
            </p>
                Demolition: Eagle-Edge Construction in Cottleville.<br>
                We received two estimates on this option. The other quote was significantly higher and not competitive.</br>

            <h2>I don't like the design. Can we change it?
            </h2>
            <p>We will not be modifying the design at this juncture. A lot of work and time was invested to get to this point with designs and pricing. A decision needed to
                be made in order to move forward with this vote, and we are requesting a vote on what is currently
                proposed. At minimum, we hope you will find the new designs a nice upgrade from what's currently in
                place.</p>

            <h2>What happens after the vote?
            </h2>
            <p>Action will be taken depending on the outcome of this vote. This project does not require homeowner
                approval nor a minimum number of votes to be submitted. The board decided to put a vote out to the
                subdivision as this extra money is outside the normal amount of what the subdivision would spend in a
                year. There is a lot of information on this site regarding replacement, but options to completely remove
                the monuments or leave them as-is is included as voting options if that's what the majority wants to see
                happen. It is important you vote on the option you'd like to see implemented.</p>

                        Proposal tab & other FAQs regarding this proposal. There are two design options with different costs. We've tried to provide as much information as

                        Carriage Hills in place. Everything would be removed: The existing signs, brick structures, concrete pads, and landscaping
                        would be excavated. Plot would be seeded with grass. No replacement monuments or signage would
                        be considered at this time for White Chapel (or Brougham potentially in the future).</p>
