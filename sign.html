                The wooden inserts on the monument signs are original from the late 1980's and are 35+ years old. These inserts are deteriorating and have rotted beyond restoration or repair. This vote is to determine a direction for the current monument signs located at White Chapel & Weldon Spring Road.

                <li>Replace current wooden sign inserts with a durable weather-resistant and modern High Density Urethane material.(estimated between 5k-9k. Information is still being gathered. Final price and information will be sent out once finalized.)</li>
                <li>Tear down existing signs/brick structures/excavate concrete pads/remove landscaping. Plot would be seeded with grass. No replacement monuments or signage would be considered at this time.(estimated around $3,500.)</li>
                <li>Leave the signs as-is. No repair work or replacement would be performed.</li><p></p>
                The goal is to utilize the current funds homeowners have been paying in over the years for this improvement project. More information will be shared once it is finalized.</li>

                The board is gathering information on sign proposals for replacement & information on removal of the monument structures. We anticipate a vote to be held during the month of February with votes due by March 1, 2023, along with the annual assessment fee. More information is expected to be provided in the annual fee letters mailed in February (and on this site) once a successful quote is determined. This project timeline is subject to change if we are unable to assess estimates by the deadline for mailing the fee letters.
