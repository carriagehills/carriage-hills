                The wooden inserts on the monument signs are original from the 1980's and are 35+ years old. These inserts have been deteriorating and are beyond repair.
                This vote is for the homeowners to determine a direction for the current monument signs located at White Chapel & Weldon Spring Road.
                <p>Cash on-hand from the subdivision account homeowners have been paying into over the years is expected to be used for this project. No extra annual cost would be incurred by homeowners for the project.
