            <p>Action will be taken based on the outcome of this vote. It is important you vote for the option you want
                implemented.</p>
            <p>
                The wooden inserts on the monument signs are original from the 1980's and are 35+ years old. These
                inserts have been deteriorating.
                This vote is for the homeowners to determine a direction for the current monument signs located at White
                Chapel & Weldon Spring Road.
            </p>
            <p>Cash on-hand from the subdivision account homeowners have been paying into over the years is expected to
                be used for this project. No extra cost would be incurred by homeowners for the project.
