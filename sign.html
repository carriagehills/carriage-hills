                The wooden inserts on the monument signs are original from the 1980's and are 35+ years old. These inserts have been deteriorating and are beyond repair.
                This vote is for the homeowners to determine a direction for the current monument signs located at White Chapel & Weldon Spring Road.
                <p>The HOA aims to use money already on-hand from the subdivision account homeowners have been paying into over the years for this project. No extra annual cost would be incurred by homeowners for the project.

                Proposed Options to Move Forward:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>REPLACE current wooden sign inserts with a durable weather-resistant High Density Urethane sign.(estimated between 5k-9k. Information is still being gathered.)</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>DEMOLISH existing signs/brick structures/excavate concrete pads/remove landscaping. Plot would be seeded with grass. No replacement monuments or signage would be considered at this time, and no signage designating the subdivision as Carriage Hills would be in place.(estimated around $3,500.)</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>LEAVE AS-IS. No repair work or replacement would be performed.</li><p></p>
